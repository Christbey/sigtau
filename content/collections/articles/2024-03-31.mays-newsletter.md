      For golf on Saturday, groups may plan among themselves to gather and make their own arrangements with the course. For anyone looking to fill a group and anyone without a group, send an e-mail to that effect to harrislawoffice@att.net so you can be connected with other golfers.<br>

      For Sporting Clays on Saturday, we will try to leave the fraternity house to head for Claythorne Lodge by Hallowell, KS about 9:30 a.m. To be clear, this is not a fraternity sponsored event. It's the "Tom Harris Invitational", intended to enjoy the sport and view the area where Brother Harris grew up. Just pay the shooting club when you show up. Brother Harris will bring suitable shotguns, but feel free to bring your own if you are driving.
