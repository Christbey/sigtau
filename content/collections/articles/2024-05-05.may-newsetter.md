      ## Exec Reports
      ### Chapter President - Jacob Johnson 1662
      This semester has been super busy with recruitment, philanthropy events, runouts, and much more! With the semester coming to a close the Active Chapter is studying hard to end the semester well and is very excited to celebrate the centennial of the Epsilon Chapter! We are also fired up and ready to start the upcoming recruitment season!
      ### Vice President - David Redding 1674
      This month the Epsilon Chapter of Sigma Tau Gamma has excelled academically. The active members are currently averaging a 3.14 GPA, with 6-10 members expected to make the Deanâ€™s Honors List for the semester. We've been preparing rigorously for finals. The house now has two binders with academic success resources, including tutor schedules and academic support contacts. Additionally, we will begin a weekly "bonfire" to enhance brotherhood and member wellness.
      ### V.P. of Membership - J.T. Bichelmeyer 1680
      We've successfully integrated two new associate members, Zach Hacker and Ivan Reyes, into active membership. As we approach summer, we are reopening the Grubs scholarship for all incoming male students, which should help extend our reach to those unfamiliar with Greek life on campus.
      ### V.P. of Programs - Koen Schanz 1681
      Throughout March, we prepared for and competed in AirBand and Greek games, taking 1st overall in AirBand and 3rd in all Greek games. The chapter also had near-perfect attendance at The Big Event. To boost morale, we introduced a new dye table and a basketball goal. We recently celebrated our White Rose Formal, nominating Alexis Ourada, a junior from Pitt State.
      ### V.P. of Finance - Josh Combs 1659
      The chapter has thrived financially, clearing our national dues and reducing our chapter dues by over $4,000. We've funded several house projects, including painting and renovations, and reframing historic pictures and certificates.
      ## Summer Rush
      We have multiple rush events planned in KC and on campus. Noteworthy events include gatherings at Chicken and Pickle on June 22nd and Top Golf on August 3rd. We also plan a Royals game suite event with all chapters from Kansas and Missouri. The semester will kick off with a BBQ on our front porch.
